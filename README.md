This project is divided into the following phases:

  1. I'll do some commmon financial analyses, such as moving windows, volatility calculation etc with Pandas.
  2. Development of a simple momentum strategy.
  3. I'll backtest the formulated trading strategy with Pandas, zipline, Quantopian.
  4. I'll perform some Optimizations to the developed strategy to make it perform better and will eventually evaluate the strategy's            performance and robustness.
